# Northcoders News API

## Introduction
This is a project that I created at Northcoders where i built an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as Reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project and run it locally:

### What you will need
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
